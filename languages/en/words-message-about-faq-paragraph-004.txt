There are multiple possible reasons why an intersection is not recognized.  One possibility is that you have misspelled a name, in which case the answer to the next question will be of interest.  Another possibility is that one street crosses the other street over a bridge or overpass, and this is not an intersection.  Another possibility is that two streets can cross each other at more than one location, in which case the chosen intersection is the one that is closer to the city&#39;s center.
