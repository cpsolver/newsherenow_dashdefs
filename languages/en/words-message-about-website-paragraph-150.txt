It took four years! sentence-next There were many challenges. sentence-next I had to evolve my ideas about how people would use the website. sentence-next I shifted to creating a open-quote web app close-quote instead of a multi hyphen-here page website, which means the website&#39;s home page is actually a single webpage that behaves like an app (but without the need to install this app). sentence-next I had to design and write foundational software that should have existed already. sentence-next I had to write code in ways that would make the web app run fast and be easy to translate into foreign languages. sentence-next And there were yet other hidden complexities. sentence-next The resulting software consists of about 3,500 files containing about 40,00 lines of code. sentence-next As I write these words, it&#39;s finally done!! sentence-next You are reading this, so apparently you like the results. sentence-next Thank you for appreciating what I created.
