You can enter a postal code and then, after that postal-code location has been found, you can click the button that takes you to the location in the Open Street Map website.  On that website you can scroll to find your intended intersection, and then you can see the names of the streets as they have been entered into the Open Street Map data, and those are the spellings you need to match.
