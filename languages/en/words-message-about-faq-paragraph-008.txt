Unlike many other websites, we don&#39;t want to know where you are.  (Please don&#39;t take this personally.)  Please do not click the &#8220;Use My GPS Location&#8221; button unless you are really comfortable with that approach.  To further protect your privacy, when you enter an intersection, do not include the street you live on.  Instead, choose another intersection that is at least a few blocks away.  And if you monitor the news at two other intersections elsewhere (such as where you work and where relatives live), that makes it even harder to know which location is near where you live.
