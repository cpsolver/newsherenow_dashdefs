Instead of filtering news based on boundaries, this News Here Now app filters news based on exact locations. sentence-next Internally each location is represented by an exact latitude and longitude, but those numbers are hidden. sentence-next What you see here are intersections that are named by the two streets that intersect. sentence-next And when you want to know where a news event or business is located, it&#39;s shown on a map. sentence-next And you have the option of seeing the exact location on the Open Street Map website, where you can scroll and zoom with complete freedom (and privacy).
