I am the author of a how hyphen-here to book on creative problem solving, so naturally I began to imagine a website where I could get location hyphen-here specific news. sentence-next I found it helpful to imagine that every intersection in my city had a virtual wooden post where nearby news could be posted. sentence-next The news would come from police and fire deparments. sentence-next And from the nearest neighbors when they hold a yard sale or need to announce a lost dog. sentence-next And magically the news posted at one intersection would be copied onto the posts at nearby intersections. sentence-next And through the magic of mobile tablets and smartphones the news could be viewed from the comfort of a favorite chair.
