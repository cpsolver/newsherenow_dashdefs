Both websites provide a way for neighbors to post lost-dog and special-event announcements, and both websites allow police departments to distribute neighborhood-specific information.  However, the NextDoor.com website only gives you news at a single location, and only at the open-quote neighborhood close-quote where you live.  But their idea of open-quote your neighborhood close-quote might not match what you think of as your neighborhood.  In contrast, the News Here Now website allows anyone to get news centered at any intersection.  Plus you can monitor news in the neighborhood where you work, and where you have relatives, and where you happen to be traveling, and anywhere else in the world.  As another advantage, the News Here Now website does not allow neighbors to write time hyphen-here wasting, annoying, or even mean hyphen-here spirited comments; all the news here will help make your neighborhood better.  Finally, those of us who want to keep our home location private cannot access that website. This concern isn&#39;t just paranoia because the NextDoor website has mistakenly revealed some home addresses to the wrong people. Hopefully the people who use both websites will share important information such as about nearby yard sales and unusual nearby police events.  In other words, the two websites serve different, yet complimentary, purposes.
